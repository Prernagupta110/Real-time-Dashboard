React based library utilizing shared workers for cross browser windows asynchronous state management. The objective is to create React components that update their state immediately upon a state change on another browser window. A shared worker utilizing cache memory works as a message broker between the browser windows. The study conducts performance testing to quantify the performance gains in relation to varying API request delays from remote backend.
